# High-Low

### I. Initiative
A gambling game between a player (rolling a 10 sided dice and guessing whether the number they roll is higher or lower than the opponent's number) and the computer (which acts as an opponent).

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics

- Random number generator that can produce an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, twice
- Comparing 2 randomly generated numbers
- Taking user input


##### Non-Functional Requirements

- The application should recognise and react to input from the keyboard 
- Inform the user about what the application expects from them

##### User Stories

- As a player, I would see what number the computer has come up with
- As a player, I would let the application wether I believe to have rolled a higher number or a lower number
- As a player, I would use the keyboard in order to interact with the application

##### How We Addressed The Requirements

How will your planned product meet the user requirements

### III. Genre

This is a gambling game of sorts: the user can achieve a "win" state based on a random guess, but they won't recieve a trackable reward of any kind.

It's also text-based, as the player has to read information from a CLI and send textual commands in order to advance the game.

### IV. Technical Details

##### Platform


##### Programming Language/Enviroment

I've used C++ 

##### Programming Challenges

My first programming challenge was creating a random number of any kind.
 
##### Constructing And Implementing My Code

Think of this as the method. How will you go about building your program?
